### Why these two
I selected **Typeahead search** and **Support assistant** because they directly impact key KPIs such as conversion rate and customer satisfaction. Typeahead search will improve the user experience by enabling faster product discovery, while the support assistant will reduce the need for manual intervention and improve response times. Both features have low integration risk and align with business goals of enhancing user engagement and reducing customer service costs.
